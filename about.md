Thanks for visiting my blog and welcome : )

My name is Xiaojie Yuan. I was major in ECE at SJTU and graduated in 2013 with a Bechelor degree. Currently, I am working as a Kernel Engineer in Sony (China) Co., Ltd. My daily work includes but is not limited to bug fixes and patch porting for Linux kernel / driver, design and development for sensor middleware and so on.

This site was originally hosted on github and redirected to [llseek.github.io](https://llseek.github.io), but in order to gain more flexibility, I have migrated it to Digital Ocean's VPS since June 18, 2015.

For the legacy wordpress verion blog, please refer [wp.llseek.com](http://wp.llseek.com).
