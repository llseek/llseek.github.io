My name is Xiaojie Yuan. I was major in ECE at SJTU and graduated in 2013 with Bechelor degree. Currently, I am working as a Kernel Engineer in Sony (China) Co., Ltd.

As a kernel noob, I like to do some kernel experiments in my spare time. The hardware platform I use is the [Beaglebone Black](http://beagleboard.org/) produced by TI who also provides a Linux-3.12 kernel within the AM335X SDK.

Recently, I am learning [Objective-C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C) and [Cocoa Touch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocoa_Touch) in order to develop games on the iOS platform. Therefore, some articles with the [Objective-C] tag will be posted from now on.

This site was originally hosted on github and redirected to [llseek.github.io](https://llseek.github.io), but I have migrated it to a VPS provided by Digital Ocean since June 18, 2015.
