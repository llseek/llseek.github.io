My name is Xiaojie Yuan. I was major in ECE at SJTU and graduated in 2013. Currently, I work as a Kernel Engineer in Sony (China).

As a kernel noob, in my part time, I use [Beaglebone Black](http://beagleboard.org/) as the development and test platform. Linux-3.12 provided in AM335X SDK is the kernel that I commonly use.
